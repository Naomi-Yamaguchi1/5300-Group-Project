# Chronic Kidney Disease

## Introduction

CKD by the Numbers
Kidney diseases are a leading cause of death in the United States.
About 37 million US adults are estimated to have CKD, and most are undiagnosed.
40% of people with severely reduced kidney function (not on dialysis) are not aware of having CKD.
Every 24 hours, 360 people begin dialysis treatment for kidney failure.
In the United States, diabetes and high blood pressure are the leading causes of kidney failure, accounting for 3 out of 4 new cases.
In 2019, treating Medicare beneficiaries with CKD cost $87.2 billion, and treating people with ESRD cost an additional $37.3 billion.
Hence, the prediction and diagnosis of CKD in its early stages is quite essential, it may be able to enable patients to receive timely treatment to ameliorate the progression of the disease.
